# Strapi application

### Description of my strapi application:
Strapi has 3 tables. Users, Helpers and Bookings.
Users are the students. Helpers are the students that have registered themselves as a student that helps other students.
And bookings is where all the bookings are registered when a student has booked help from a helper.
